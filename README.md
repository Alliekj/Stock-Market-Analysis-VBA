To write my code, I consulted chat gpt as well as a friend that is employed as a software engineer. When neither of those resources could help me, I used 
www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples to help me format my charts in particular. My code looks a bit different than the way loops were taught in the lesson
because this other way felt more intuitive to me and I tend to favor writing everything out with variables so that I can understand and remember what
I've done in a more meaningful way. Thank you!
